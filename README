Requirements
- mongo
- ruby host that supports rack and sinatra (cough... heroku)

Code is released under a pretty basic license: do whatever you want with this but please credit Kyle Bragger (kyle@kylebragger.com). Also, I'm not able to support this code (that's not to say I will be a dick about answering your question)

Enjoy.
